                        I created the gender-wage data visualization for a data visualization class I took in 2020.

                        The project was successful and was selected to be an example as a demonstration of work for future classes. However having it been made more than a year ago, I have grown much more as a developer and designer since I have created this visualization, and I wanted to improve on this existing project iwht my newfound skills. Firstly, I wanted to use a more aesthetic color scheme that wasen't focused purely on visual constrast. Secondly, I wanted to make the design responsive, as this version of the graph is very difficult to navigate on mobile devices. <br><br>

                        We started our research by consulting Kevin Pham, the team manager. As the team manager for multiple years, we believed that Kevin would have an understanding of the needs of both team members and potential recruits. We therefore created a rough persona of Kevin to understand his wants and needs, and how to design our website in that would assist him in his duties as a manager

                        After completing Kevin's persona, we started to formalize the goals for the website. The main features Kevin wanted to see were on making the website sustainable for the years to come, honoring the legacy of past generations of SJDB, and helping raise awareness of SJDB both on and off-campus. Based on the information we gathered, our goals for the website were as follows

As an example, some members of SJDB wanted a way to voice their opinions and positive experiences with the team, which led to me creating the flashcard system <br><br>Outside of this, the sport of dragonboat has played a huge role in my early adulthood years, and being able to build a website that would help bring awareness towards dragon boat was deeply fullfilling for me
