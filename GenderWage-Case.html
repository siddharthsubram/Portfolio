                        I created the gender-wage data visualization for a data visualization class I took in 2020. As part of the assignment, I recreated David McCandles visualization of the gender-wage gap (<a style = " color :#7c3f6e; text-decoration: none;" href = "//www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/gender-pay-gap/"> View it here </a>) and attempted to add additional functionality of it. My version of his visualization allowed for displaying data over many years, and for displaying the wage gap of a particular occupation when hovered.

                        The project was successful and was selected to be an example of work for future classes. However having it been made more than a year ago, I  wanted to improve on this project with my current skills. <br> <br>

                        When I initially finished the visualization, my instructor suggested creating a way to <span style = "font-weight:bold";> display the change in wage over time</span>. I was unable to create that feature then, but I wanted to add that functionality this time   <br><br>

                        My overall goals for this iteration were as follows

                        By rendering the graph at at the maximum viewport width of the screen, it will be displayed at the largest width, and graph components can shrink down to scale. But shrinking the graph labels such as occupation names would greatly reduce readability, while not shrinking them at all would cause too much of the graph to be taken up by labels, reducing contrast in wage gaps. <br><br> 

                        To solve this problem, I <span style = "font-weight:bold";> shorthanded the names of several occupations. </span> I then allowed the full names to be displayed when hovered, <span style = "font-weight:bold";>prioritizing readability. </span>

                        Through the creationg of the SJDB landing page, I learned that website contributions don't have to come from solely designers and developers. As an example, some members of SJDB wanted a way to voice their opinions and positive experiences with the team, which led to me creating the flashcard system <br><br>Outside of this, the sport of dragonboat has played a huge role in my early adulthood years, and being able to build a website that would help bring awareness towards dragon boat was deeply fullfilling for me
