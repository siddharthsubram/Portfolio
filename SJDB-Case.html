                        San Jose Dragon Boat(SJDB) is an SJSU affiliated collegiate dragon boat team, which is a canoe sport originating from ancient China. However, the collegiate dragon boat scene is largely dominated by the same 4-5 universities with established competitive legacys, so high school dragon boat athletes prefer to go to these schools to continue dragon boating. As a result, schools like SJSU do not attract many experienced dragon boat athletes due to the little exposure the team has. I created this website along with Qunyh to solve the problem of <span style = "font-weight:bold";>creating a website to help SJDB gain online presence and exposure

                        We started our research by consulting Kevin Pham, the team manager. As the team manager for multiple years, we believed that Kevin would have an understanding of the needs of both team members and potential recruits. We therefore created a rough persona of Kevin to understand his wants and needs, and how to design our website in that would assist him in his duties as a manager

                        After completing Kevin's persona, we started to formalize the goals for the website. The main features Kevin wanted to see were on making the website sustainable for the years to come, honoring the legacy of past generations of SJDB, and helping raise awareness of SJDB both on and off-campus. Based on the information we gathered, our goals for the website were as follows

                        We opted for a multi page design in order to compartmentalize relevant information in distict pages, allowing for more whitespace that could be filled with team pictures and media that would capture the spirit of SJDB

                        As we were building our website for an SJSU affiliated sports team, we initially wanted our colors to represent the school's colors of regal blue and yellow. But after realizing that past iterations of SJDB merchandise and logos featured primarily darker blue colros and using yellow sparingly as an accent, we decided to follow suite with that previous color scheme to pay homage to the team's legacy and history

                        As a major concern was long-term scalability, we developed the website in a highly modular fashion. Allowing future SJDB members with little coding experience to be able to easily add or delete website content such as adding new officer memebers

                        To highlight current and past SJDB members, officers, and alunni, we built a flashcard system that interested team members could fill out to be featured on the website.

                        Through the creationg of the SJDB landing page, I learned that website contributions don't have to come from solely designers and developers. As an example, some members of SJDB wanted a way to voice their opinions and positive experiences with the team, which led to me creating the flashcard system <br><br>Outside of this, the sport of dragonboat has played a huge role in my early adulthood years, and being able to build a website that would help bring awareness towards dragon boat was deeply fullfilling for me
